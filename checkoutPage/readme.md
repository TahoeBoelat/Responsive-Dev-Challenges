## Overview
Hello everyone this is my fourth responsive page challenge in devchallenge.io. You all maybe think why this challenge took a mont for finishing isn't it? That's because im still learning about JS so for this time i dont have enough knowledge and skill about JS especially for DOM lol. Anyways this is it, my project. I hope u all give me a feedback so i can improve my skill. Thank you very much.
